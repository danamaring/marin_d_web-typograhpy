			<h1>Napoli-Villareal <br> A Europa League Tie Worthy of the Champions Leage </h1>

		<p> 
			<span class="drop-cap">N</span>apoli and Villarreal are all set to lock horns in the Round of 32 in the Europa League and I'm far from happy about it. Don't get me wrong, I'm eagerly anticipating the first leg at the Stadio San Paolo tonight, but to all intents and purposes this should be a Champions League encounter.

			The star power and talent that will be on display deserves a stage that is befitting of the occasion like Leonard Cohen at the Isle of Wight in 1970 or Nirvana at the Reading Festival in '92.
		</p>
		<p>
			Both teams sit in the top four of their respective leagues and have won over pundits and fans alike with their carefree brand of free-flowing football. Just as some people like to complain that they were born in the wrong decade, fate has handed the Yellow Submarine a raw deal. Their task consists of trying to dethrone Barcelona, who are the most aesthetically pleasing outfit on the planet and possess more attacking talent than Alexander the Great's famed Companion Cavalry.
